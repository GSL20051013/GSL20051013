  <h2>1. Finding the Area of a Given Triangle Using Vector Algebra</h2>
  <p>To find the area of a triangle with vertices A, B, and C, you can use the cross product of two vectors that form two sides of the triangle.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Create two vectors representing two sides of the triangle, for example, <b>AB</b> = B - A and <b>AC</b> = C - A.</li>
    <li>Calculate the cross product of these two vectors: <b>AB</b> &times; <b>AC</b>.</li>
    <li>Find the magnitude of the resulting vector: |<b>AB</b> &times; <b>AC</b>|.</li>
    <li>The area of the triangle is half the magnitude of the cross product:
      <div class="formula">Area = &frac12; |<b>AB</b> &times; <b>AC</b>|</div>
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>2. Determining whether given lines form a Triangle or a Straight Line using vectors</h2>
  <p>Given three points A, B, and C, you can determine if they form a triangle or a straight line by analyzing the vectors between them.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Straight Line:</b> The points form a straight line if the vectors between them are parallel. For example, if <b>AB</b> is a scalar multiple of <b>AC</b> (i.e., <b>AB</b> = k * <b>AC</b> for some scalar k).</li>
    <li><b>Triangle:</b> The points form a triangle if the vectors are not parallel.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="question">
  <h2>3. Finding the Scalar Equation of the Plane using vectors</h2>
  <p>To find the scalar equation of a plane, you need a point on the plane and a vector normal (perpendicular) to the plane.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Find a normal vector <b>n</b> to the plane. If you have three points A, B, and C on the plane, you can find the normal vector by taking the cross product of two vectors in the plane, e.g., <b>n</b> = <b>AB</b> &times; <b>AC</b>.</li>
    <li>Choose a point P₀(x₀, y₀, z₀) on the plane.</li>
    <li>The vector equation of the plane is (<b>r</b> - <b>r</b>₀) &middot; <b>n</b> = 0, where <b>r</b> is the position vector of any point (x, y, z) on the plane.</li>
    <li>Substitute the values into the vector equation and simplify to get the scalar equation in the form ax + by + cz = d.</li>

  <h2>4. Judging whether the given 3D lines are skew lines</h2>
  <p>Two lines in 3D space are skew if they are not parallel and do not intersect.</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Check if the direction vectors of the two lines are parallel. If they are, the lines are not skew.</li>
    <li>If the direction vectors are not parallel, check if the lines intersect. To do this, set the vector equations of the two lines equal to each other and see if there is a solution for the parameters. If there is no solution, the lines do not intersect, and are therefore skew.</li>
